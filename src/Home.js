                <p className='pera pera1'>Worried parents fear the leaked data could be used to threaten their children. These concerns come amid disturbing scenes that have emerged this week of frenzied mobs shouting and waving saffron scarves and flags as they confront young Muslim girls in colleges across several districts.

                <p className='pera pera2'>The Police Superintendent of Udupi district, N Vishnuvardhan, has confirmed that a written complaint has been made. 'Appropriate action will be taken' once documentary evidence of the leaked information is available, he was quoted by news agency PTI.

                The students whose info was leaked are believed to be the same who first protested being denied the right to wear the hijab in class. Since then protests have spread, triggering pushback from right-wing groups and a political row with communal overtones.
